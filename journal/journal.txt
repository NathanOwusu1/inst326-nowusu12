Week 1 
This week I used ChatGPT in a few different ways. For my INST 201 class, I asked it to help me summarize readings so I could understand the main points more quickly. It gave me shorter and clearer explanations that made it easier to review before class. I also used ChatGPT to get ideas for sourcing materials for assignments. It suggested some possible sources and explained how they could be useful, which gave me a good starting point even though I still had to double-check them. Finally, for my ENES: Discovering New Ventures class, I used ChatGPT to better understand the book Iâ€™m reading. Some of the concepts were hard to follow, but the AI explained them in simpler terms and gave real-world examples that helped me connect the reading to what we were covering in class. Overall, it saved me time and improved my comprehension across both classes.

This week I used ai to help me prepare for my entrepreneurship quiz review questions about motivation, self-efficacy, and growth mindset. Chat Gpt helped me create review questions and a practice quiz based on the content from the class. This helped me get a perfect score on my quiz while using minimal effort to study.

This week I used Chat gpt to help me with my programming exercises. I asked for explanations of concepts like how to normalize a string in Python, how to check availability in a list of booleans, and how to use loops to count items. It gave me examples of how functions could be used and explained the difference between the exact matches and fuzzy matches in searching.
I also used AI to help debugg, when I accidentally left extra code (pass) in one of my functions, which caused errors. The AI pointed out what was wrong and showed me the corrected version.
Overall, I tried to write most of the code on my own, but when I got stuck, I used AI as a tutor to explain what the code should do, or to check that my logic was correct.
