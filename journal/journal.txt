Week 1 
This week I used ChatGPT in a few different ways. For my INST 201 class, I asked it to help me summarize readings so I could understand the main points more quickly. It gave me shorter and clearer explanations that made it easier to review before class. I also used ChatGPT to get ideas for sourcing materials for assignments. It suggested some possible sources and explained how they could be useful, which gave me a good starting point even though I still had to double-check them. Finally, for my ENES: Discovering New Ventures class, I used ChatGPT to better understand the book I’m reading. Some of the concepts were hard to follow, but the AI explained them in simpler terms and gave real-world examples that helped me connect the reading to what we were covering in class. Overall, it saved me time and improved my comprehension across both classes.

This week I used ai to help me prepare for my entrepreneurship quiz review questions about motivation, self-efficacy, and growth mindset. Chat Gpt helped me create review questions and a practice quiz based on the content from the class. This helped me get a perfect score on my quiz while using minimal effort to study.

This week I used Chat gpt to help me with my programming exercises. I asked for explanations of concepts like how to normalize a string in Python, how to check availability in a list of booleans, and how to use loops to count items. It gave me examples of how functions could be used and explained the difference between the exact matches and fuzzy matches in searching.
I also used AI to help debugg, when I accidentally left extra code (pass) in one of my functions, which caused errors. The AI pointed out what was wrong and showed me the corrected version.
Overall, I tried to write most of the code on my own, but when I got stuck, I used AI as a tutor to explain what the code should do, or to check that my logic was correct. 

AI Usage Journal – Week 4

This week, I used  ChatGPT to help me with the Week 4 programming exercises that were concentrated on classes and objects. I wanted help on the structure of defining classes using __init__ methods and instance methods. For example, I used it to help me think through how to track copies of books, how to format ISBN numbers, and how to manage user notes in a class based program.
 I also used AI to confirm my logic and assure an example, if I was not sure how to add or manage object attributes, like counters or booleans. It also assisted in debugging small mistakes, like forgetting to return, and/list upon initialization in constructors.
Overall, I wrote most of the code myself and looked at AI as an assistant in learning. It helped clarify the structure of a class, along with confirming my understanding of the requirements of the class exercises.

This week, I used ChatGPT to help me understand encapsulation and data hiding in Python. I asked for examples of how to create protected and private attributes, use getters and setters, and double check data using @property. I also used it to help me debugg and fix errors in my code for the class exercises.
Overall, ai helped me clarify concepts and double check the code I wrote myself. It was useful for learning how to structure clean, well-encapsulated classes.

This week I continued to work on my programming exercises in Python for Week 6. I asked ChatGPT of the differences between instance methods, class methods, and static methods and it provided short examples and outlined when to use each based on the assigned homework and helped me to better understand the classified concepts of the homework. I also used ChatGPT to assist with assisting my debugging process and reasoning through aspects programmed within the code that were more challenging for my level of practice e.g. date calculations, appropriate class-wide counters, etc.

AI Usage Journal – Week 7

This week I used ChatGPT to help me with the Week 7 programming exercises on exception handling and unit testing. The topics included try/except/else/finally blocks, creating and raising custom exceptions, and writing unittest test cases. I used chat gpt mainly as a guide to better understand how to handle different error types correctly and how to write clear, readable test cases for each function.
For example, it helped me structure functions like validate_isbn, parse_copies, and safe_load_catalog so they raised the right exceptions instead of crashing the program. It also explained how to use assertRaises and subTest in unittest to check multiple conditions efficiently. When I was confused about why a try/finally block was needed or how to catch a KeyboardInterrupt gracefully, the AI walked me through examples that made the logic much clearer.

This week I used ChatGPT to help me with the  programming exercises about inheritance, method overriding, and polymorphism. I asked it for help designing subclasses like PrintedBook, EBook, AudioBook, and ReferenceBook, and how to properly use super() when extending the base Book class. It explained how polymorphism allows each subclass to have its own behavior.
I also used AI to check that my LoanDesk class followed good object- oriented principles especially distinguishing between composition and inheritance. It helped me understand how methods like checkout_message() and can_checkout() could be overridden to simplify logic and make the system more flexible.
