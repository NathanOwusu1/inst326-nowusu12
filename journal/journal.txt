Week 1 
This week I used ChatGPT in a few different ways. For my INST 201 class, I asked it to help me summarize readings so I could understand the main points more quickly. It gave me shorter and clearer explanations that made it easier to review before class. I also used ChatGPT to get ideas for sourcing materials for assignments. It suggested some possible sources and explained how they could be useful, which gave me a good starting point even though I still had to double-check them. Finally, for my ENES: Discovering New Ventures class, I used ChatGPT to better understand the book Iâ€™m reading. Some of the concepts were hard to follow, but the AI explained them in simpler terms and gave real-world examples that helped me connect the reading to what we were covering in class. Overall, it saved me time and improved my comprehension across both classes.
